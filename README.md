### Hey 👋

By day I write software, by night I'm ~~Batma...~~ an avid 🍺 drinker and novice whiskey connoisseur.

Currently giving [Go](https://go.dev/) a good shake after years of taking the piss out of it 🙏

Long time JVM dev. Started out with Java 1.4, punished myself with Scala for a few years when it was cool, but most of the last half a decade or so has been with Kotlin (on the backend!).

I've worked on systems of nearly every type by now, both backend and frontend, distributed and not so much and with a wide range of languages and technologies. Some might call this *"Full Stack"*. 

Started my career building real-time systems for Tier 1 investment banks (**yes with the JVM! no, it wasn't slow** 🖕). Last few years have been spent in cryptocurrency land building tools and platforms for the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain, including a block explorer and a private [MEV](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/) relay.
